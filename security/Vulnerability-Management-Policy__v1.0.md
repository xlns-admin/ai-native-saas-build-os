# Vulnerability Management Policy

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines the systematic process for identifying, assessing, prioritising, remediating, and tracking security vulnerabilities across the SaaS platform, infrastructure, dependencies, and AI-assisted components.

The objective is to reduce exploitability risk through continuous, measurable vulnerability lifecycle management.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Application code (frontend, backend, APIs)  
- Infrastructure (cloud resources, containers, CI/CD pipelines)  
- Third-party libraries and dependencies  
- AI model integrations and SDKs  
- Container images and base OS layers  
- Developer tooling used in production build pipelines  

This policy applies to all environments:

- Development  
- Staging  
- Production  

---

## 3. Definition

A vulnerability is a weakness in software, infrastructure, configuration, or dependency that could be exploited to compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

---

## 4. Vulnerability Sources

Vulnerabilities may be identified through:

- Automated dependency scanning (e.g. Dependabot or equivalent)  
- Container image scanning  
- Static application security testing (SAST)  
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST)  
- Cloud security posture monitoring  
- Manual code review  
- External disclosure (responsible disclosure or security researcher)  
- Threat intelligence feeds (e.g. CVE databases)  

All vulnerability discovery channels must be logged and traceable.

---

## 5. Classification & Severity

Vulnerabilities must be classified using a recognised scoring system, such as:

- CVSS v3.x base score  

### Severity Bands

| Severity | CVSS Score | Risk Level |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Critical | 9.0 – 10.0 | Immediate exploitability or high impact |
| High     | 7.0 – 8.9  | Serious impact, likely exploit |
| Medium   | 4.0 – 6.9  | Moderate risk |
| Low      | 0.1 – 3.9  | Minimal impact |

If CVSS is unavailable, risk must be assessed manually using:

- Exploitability  
- Exposure surface  
- Data sensitivity  
- Business impact  

Manual scoring rationale must be documented.

---

## 6. Remediation Timeframes (SLA)

| Severity | Remediation Target |
|----------|-------------------|
| Critical | 72 hours |
| High     | 7 calendar days |
| Medium   | 30 days |
| Low      | Next planned release |

If remediation is not possible within SLA:

- A documented risk acceptance decision must be recorded.  
- Compensating controls must be defined.  
- Expiry date for risk acceptance must be assigned.  

---

## 7. Remediation Process

1. Vulnerability identified.  
2. Severity assigned.  
3. Issue logged in tracking system.  
4. Fix implemented or mitigation applied.  
5. Verification performed.  
6. Closure documented.  

All remediation must be:

- Traceable to a specific vulnerability ID.  
- Linked to a change record or PR.  
- Reviewed before deployment.  

Emergency remediation must follow Change Management Protocol.

---

## 8. Third-Party Dependency Management

All production dependencies must:

- Be actively maintained upstream.  
- Have a documented version.  
- Be reviewed for licensing risks.  
- Be updated regularly.  

Critical vulnerabilities in dependencies must not be deferred unless:

- A compensating control exists.  
- Risk acceptance is formally recorded.  

Abandoned dependencies must trigger architectural review.

---

## 9. AI-Specific Vulnerability Considerations

For AI-enabled systems:

- Prompt injection risks must be reviewed.  
- Model misuse or abuse patterns must be monitored.  
- AI SDK dependencies must be scanned.  
- Sensitive data must not be exposed to external model APIs without explicit approval.  
- AI output handling must not introduce configuration tampering risks.  

AI integrations are treated as third-party dependencies under this policy.

---

## 10. Reporting & Metrics

The following metrics must be tracked:

- Total open vulnerabilities by severity  
- Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR)  
- Percentage remediated within SLA  
- Critical vulnerability recurrence rate  

Metrics must be reviewed periodically by the Human Orchestrator or designated security authority.

Trend deterioration must trigger review.

---

## 11. Risk Acceptance

Risk acceptance requires:

- Written justification  
- Business impact analysis  
- Approval from decision authority  
- Defined compensating control  
- Explicit review date  

Risk acceptance must not exceed 90 days without re-evaluation.

Expired risk acceptances must block release.

---

## 12. Continuous Improvement

This policy must be reviewed at least annually or following:

- A major security incident  
- Introduction of new architecture  
- Change in regulatory environment  
- Significant expansion of AI capabilities  

Lessons from incidents must update this policy where applicable.

---

## 13. Non-Goals

This policy does not:

- Guarantee zero vulnerabilities  
- Replace secure design principles  
- Eliminate the need for security testing  

It establishes disciplined response, not perfection.

---

## 14. Ownership

The Human Orchestrator retains ultimate accountability for vulnerability management.

Delegation of remediation tasks does not delegate responsibility.
